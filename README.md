Module 15 Challenge

Maps out all earthquakes in the last 7 days. Smaller magnitude earthquakes have smaller dots and larger magnitude earthquakes have larger dots. They're colored green to red based on depth, red being the deepest. The color code is in the legend to the bottom right. You can click each marker for more information. The data is being pulled from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

logic.js has the javascript, index.html can be viewed to see the map. You can also view it on my github page https://jaxion08.github.io/leaflet-challenge/
